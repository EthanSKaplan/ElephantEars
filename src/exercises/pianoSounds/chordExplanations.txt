Explanations on what certain symbols in chords mean.
From this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMLdWrZqwLg

C, major
Cm or C-, minor
Cdim or C°, diminished triad
Caug or C+ or C(#5), augmented triad
Csus4, suspended 4th triad
Csus2, suspended 2nd triad
Csus, referring to Csus4
C7, dominant 7th chord
Cm7, minor triad with dominant 7th
Cmaj7 or C△7 or C△, major 7th chord (△ means major in jazz)
CmM7, minor triad with major 7th
Cdim7 or C°7, minor triad with diminished 7th (same as major 6th) -> stack of minor thirds
C⊘7 or Cm7(b5), half diminished 7th aka minor triad with flat 5 and dominant 7th

Upper Chord Extensions
Cadd9, C chord plus 9th scale degree
C9, "Stack up" to the 9th so include the 7th aka C7(add9)
C11, "stack up" to 11th aka [1,3,5,b7,9,11]
Cadd11, C triad plus add 11th scale degree
C13, stack up to 13th aka [1,3,5,b7,9,11,13] (but usually the third or fifth is omitted because this chord is so dense already)

omit (or sometimes 'no')
C7sus4 (omit5), normal C7sus4 but remove the fifth

Upper chord extension alterations (sharps and flats)
[1,3,5,b7,9,11,b13] isn't labeled E(b13) because this could be confused with Eb13. It's labeled E11(b13)
Cmaj9, stack Cmaj7 and add a 9th

Power chords
C5, [1,5] but usually [1,5,8]

6th chord
C6, [1,3,5,6]
Cm6, [1,b3,5,6] you still add the 6th from the MAJOR scale even though this is a minor chord
Cm(b6) or Cm(add b6), [1,b3,5,b6]
C^{6}_{9} or C(add 6)(add 9), [1,3,5,6,9]

Altered chords -> not one specific chord but a family of possible altered chords
Calt -> C7 with either a flat or sharp 5. And/or we can add a flat/sharp 9. So:
  [1,3,b5,b7]
  [1,3,#5,b7]
  [1,3,b5,b7,b9]
  [1,3,#5,b7,#9]

Slash chords -> play left side as normal chord but play right side as lowest note
C/E, CEG or [3,5,8]
  note: this is an inversion because C major chord already includes E
G/A, actually A11 chord but you're only playing [1,b7,9,13]
